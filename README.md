# ComputerGraphics
This repo contains several small WebGL programs that I created for my Computer Graphics class at the University of North Texas.

The programs themselves are written in JavaScript, with HTML drivers that execute them. If you wish to run any of the programs, be sure to pull the whole repo, including the "matsuda" folder - it contains necessary utilities and other scripts.
